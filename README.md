This is my attempt to make this merge feed. It kind of works but admittedly it's not perfect. If you have a better idea of how to do it then please make suggestions in the [Issues](https://github.com/MichaelTunnell/dln-rss-merge/issues).

### Dependencies:
- PHP
- SimpleXML (PHP)
- RSS Mix ([rssmix.com](http://rssmix.com/))

I am open to any suggestions including potential replacements but I would prefer PHP because I at least partially understand it. :D
If it would be better to replace RSSMix with SimplePie for example then I am open to that as well. This might be a better approach anyway but I'm not sure.

If you'd like to help please reply in the [DLN Forum thread](https://discourse.destinationlinux.network/t/help-us-merge-dlns-rss-feeds/2700) or [create an issue](https://github.com/MichaelTunnell/dln-rss-merge/issues) here on github.
